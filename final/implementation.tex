\subsection{Laser Setup}

    \subsubsection{Laser Seeding}
    %============================

The laser setup begins with the master laser.  This laser feeds its light into a slave laser which, if properly tuned, will emit light of the same frequency as its master. That slave then feeds into another slave (\emph{Slave \#2}), which is the light source for this setup.  Particularly, there are a series of mirrors which direct the light from the second slave into the third slave.  Setting up this slave requires a particular algorithm (which must be executed before any work can be done each day):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Lock the master laser and first slave.  This is somewhat involved, and beyond the scope of this document.
 \item Set the current on this slave \#2 to a low value, 32 mA is used.
 \item Place a power meter at the output of this slave laser.
 \item Adjust the two mirrors feeding master light into the slave, until the power output from the slave laser is maximised.
 \item Unlock the master laser.  Set it to sweep frequency across a wide enough range that the Rb85 and Rb87 absorption features are visible on the master's diagnostic scope.
 \item Make sure that light from the slave laser is fed back to the diagnostic table (via fibre coupling)\footnote{The diagnostic table includes a scope which shows the spectrum of a rubidium sample, and includes provisions for checking the spectral content of the light.  It is a crucial tool for debugging problems with the laser.}  Check with the power meter that >50\% of the slave light is entering the fibre (there are many reasons why the light might not make it this far.
 \item Set the current into the slave to a high value (110.0mA), and gradually decrease it.  Observe that there is a stable frequency window in which the slave can operate, and that adjusting the current moves this window.  Reduce the current of the slave until the laser is stable across all desired features.  The window should be wide enough to contain both the Rb85 and Rb87 transitions.
 \item The master should either be re-locked, or have its frequency sweep set to a useful range.
\end{enumerate}
Following this procedure, the laser is ready for experimental use.

    \subsubsection{Laser Sweeping}
    %=============================

The master laser is nominally operated in a \emph{locked frequency} mode.  There is a lock-box which provides this function, and an AOM-based locking system.  This provides a fast (current based) and slow (piezo based)\footnote{This depends on the laser topology but there is typically a piezo actuated diffraction grating which selects for lasing frequencies.} feedback response, which keeps the laser's frequency as stable as possible. \\

However, if this feedback is disabled, the laser will run in an open-loop \emph{frequency sweeping} mode.  The lock box does not change the current, instead it adjusts the laser's frequency with a triangle wave ramp which operates at 50Hz.  This provides frequency sweep which is very slow compared to the locking servo, but fast enough to give a continuous view of the spectral response of the new feedback system.  For example, by sending this beam through a rubidium gas cell, and placing a detector on the far side, a plot of the absorption spectrum of rubidium as a function of frequency is generated. \\

Note that although the sweep speed is fixed (50 Hz), the frequency range of the sweep is set manually by tuning a potentiometer.  Thus, measurements of the sweep rate (MHz/s) need to be done on a per-dataset basis.  No attempt was made to reproduce the exact sweep rate between measurements, although some measurements may have been done without adjusting the settings.  For reference, the sweep rate was set to roughly 120 MHz/s for the variable power error signal data.

    \subsubsection{Fibre Alignment}
    %==============================

In this section an  example algorithm for aligning fibre couplers is presented.  Much alignment was done in the timespan of this project, so it is worth outlining the procedure that was followed. \\

Each beam has four degrees of freedom.  Thus aligning the beams (in two axes) in two locations is sufficient to have the beams perfectly aligned.  This is required for both fibre couplers and cavities. \\

Fibre couplers:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Use a laser pen\footnotemark to create a narrow beam coming out of the fibre.  This will be used to determine the alignment of the coupler.
 \item Place a transparent IR card near the fibre coupler such that you can see both the pen laser, and the slave laser beam.
 \item Adjust the last mirror before the coupler until these two beams line up precisely.
 \item Place the transparent IR card past the last mirror.
 \item Adjust the fibre coupler until the two beams line up.
 \item Remove the pen laser and IR card.  Attach the power meter to the fibre coupler.  You should see some power.
 \item Adjust the same four degrees of freedom on the mirror and coupler, maximising the power entering the fibre coupler.  These should be small adjustments.
\end{enumerate}

\footnotetext{A laser pen (the lab has one they call they \emph{spaghetti laser}) is a laser used for aligning optics.  It is small, portable, and includes an adapter which a fibre can be plugged into.  It is designed to feed a visible beam out the fibre so that the alignment of the fibre is completely clear.}

\subsection{Optical Table}

  \label{optical_setup}

\begin{figure}

  \centering\caption{A schematic overview of the optical setup.}
  \label{optics}
\end{figure}

An photograph the optical setup is shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{optical_setup}}.  A schematic view of the same setup is shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{optics}}.

    \subsubsection{Collimation}
    %============================

The beam that comes out of the fibre coupler spreads too wide over the optical path of the feedback loop.  Thus, a telescope system using lenses with focal lengths of 400 mm and -100 mm was installed for the input beam to reduce the size. Also, by moving one of the lenses, the divergence can be adjusted. This setup was calibrated to have a visibly collimated optical path length of about 2--3 metres. Collimation and a relatively small beam size (1/e diameter of no more than 1 mm) are important. Collimation ensures constant beam intensities in the vapour cell. Beam sizes larger than the face of the EOM crystal result in undesirable diffraction patterns.

    \subsubsection{Power Control}
    %============================

In several parts of the system, require precise control of beam power.  Specifically, this is needed in three locations: \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The power of the pump beam.
    \item The power of the probe beam.
    \item The power distribution between the diagnostic table and the detector.  The detector was visibly saturating in some tests, so this final stage is necessary.  It also makes diagnostics easier if a wide range of power can be arbitrarily redirected to the diagnostic table.
\end{enumerate}

In each of these locations, there is a half-wave plate followed by a pol cube.  The half wave plate rotates the polarization of linear polarized light.  The pol cube allows horizontally polarized light to pass straight through, while reflecting vertically polarized light\footnote{The pol cube does not work with 100\% efficiency. Some horizontally polarized light will reflect and some vertically polarized light will pass straight through. This is commonly referred to as the `extinction ratio' and it puts a lower limit on the power levels in a given path}.

    \subsubsection{EOM and Crystal Driver}
    %===================================

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{figures/eom_driver.jpg}
  \caption[EOM driver CCA]{The existing home-built EOM driver CCA. The attenuation and phase adjustment potentiometers are visible.  Also visible, the output port (to EOM) and the ref output port (to LO).}
  \label{eom_driver}
\end{figure}

An EOM crystal driver was borrowed from the Phys 408 Optics lab.  It is shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{eom_driver}}.  The availability of a working device greatly reduced the cost overhead of this project.  The driver generates a sinusoidal signal at approximately 20MHz, and is tuned to drive the high capacitance of the EOM crystal at a high voltage.  It also feeds out a reference to its internal oscillator.  This signal provides the local oscillator input for demodulation. \\

The EOM driver also includes a phase shift potentiometer to account for phase shifts that may occur in electrical lines or the optical path.  However, the shift provided by this potentiometer is inadequate, with an approximate range of $\lambda/6$, as shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:eom_phase}} (at least $\lambda/2$ would be ideal).  Additionally, during testing, changes in oscillator composition were noticed on the oscilloscope when the potentiometer was turned. To avoid debugging the onboard functionality, a phase delay was manually introduced using BNC cables of various lengths.  Of the cables tried, a 1.5 m cable provided the best signal (but this method is clearly suboptimal).\\

The light passing into the EOM must be horizontally polarized, thus a half-wave plate is used to re-polarize the light before it enters the EOM.

  \label{fig:eom_phase}
\end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Pump Probe Modulation Transfer}
    %=============================================

The an EOM-modulated beam is fed into the sample from one direction (the \emph{pump} beam).  A single frequency beam (from the slave laser) passes through the gas in the opposite direction (the \emph{probe} beam).  Due to nonlinear interactions in the gas, the probe beam becomes modulated at the driving frequency of the pump beam.  That is, the pump beam modulates the gas, which in turn, modulates the probe beam. \\

The physics of the interaction between the two beams and the gas are described further in \textbf{Section \ref{sec:theory}}. \\

Note that the cell has been installed at a slight angle, to minimize reflections off the surface of the cell, while maintaining the optical path.

    \subsubsection{Rb Cell Beam Expander}
    %====================================

The Rb gas cell has been surrounded in telescoping lenses to expand both the probe and pump beam.  This improves the signal-to-noise ratio by passing the beam through a larger fraction of the gas in the cell.  The telescopes increase the diameter of both beams by a factor of three using lenses with focal lengths of 75mm and -25mm.

\vfill

    \subsubsection{Heated Rb Cell}
    %=============================

It was thought that heating the rubidium cell might improve the SNR of this system.  At room temperature, a fraction of the rubidium in the cell exists as a solid on the surface of the cell.  By heating the cell, more rubidium will vapourize, increasing the density of the gas.  This causes the laser to pass through more gas, which strengthens the signal. \\

However, this effect cannot be used to arbitrary temperatures.  Increasing the temperature increase the vapour pressure, but it also increases the speed of the gas molecules, which causes the Doppler broadening to become worse, until the response ultimately becomes flat.  This effect is known as pressure broadening, and puts an upper limit on the possible performance improvements. \\

Heating was done with a pre-built heating coil and a measured with a K-type thermocouple.  For each temperature measurement, the heater was activated, and it's current load was manually adjusted the current output until the temperature reading on the thermocouple had remained stable for five minutes.  At the point of sampling, the heater was shut off (to eliminate any magnetic fields created by the current), and a measurement of the error signal was taken.

    \subsubsection{Cavity Wave Detector}
    %===================================

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/cavity.pdf}
  \caption[Confocal cavity test setup]{Confocal cavity test setup.  The EOM is passed through a half wave plate, which allows us to adjust its polarization, and then through a pol cube which removes any vertically polarized light, leaving only horizontally polarized light.  The piezo element is fed by a function generator, and the piezo driving force, which corresponds to frequency, is plotted against the response of the photodetector.}
  \label{cavity}
\end{figure}

A confocal cavity was used to measure the effect the EOM has on the beam, to ensure that sidebands are in fact being created.  The setup of this cavity is shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{cavity}}. The cavity resonates more highly with laser light that fits in an integer number of wavelengths within the cavity.  Having a photodiode on the end allows for measurement of the resonance amplitude.  The backside of the cavity can be moved by adjusting the voltage applied to a piezo system.  By feeding a triangular wave in (from a function generator), the (rough) frequency spectrum of the beam is observed. The spectrum shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:eom_wave}} indicates that the EOM driver is functioning correctly.


\begin{figure}
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/eom_wave.pdf}
  \caption[EOM spectrum]{EOM spectrum as viewed from the detector of a confocal cavity.  Sidebands appear on the light wave at $\pm$20 MHz from the carrier (which was calibrated from the free spectral range of the cavity). The measured sideband amplitudes were $14\pm1$\% of the carrier, which is approximately a 1:7:1 split of total power.}
  \label{fig:eom_wave}
\end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Modulation Transfer Reference}
    %============================================

Since the frequency was sweept during the main tests, the low-frequency (near DC) part of the signal was isolated to give an indication of the actual modulation transfer spectrum.  This provided a continuous reference of which part of the spectrum was being sampled at all times. Additionally, this indicated how well the modulation transfer was working. The raw signal itself is sent into the signal conditioning box, which converts it into a usable error signal. \\

\subsection{Signal Conditioning}
\label{sec:signalcond}

\end{figure}

A schematical overview of the signal conditioning stages is shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:rf_design}}.

    \subsubsection{Photosensors}
    %===============================

Originally, it was intended to make use of the Finisar HFD6180 based `ROSA' sensors that were recently acquired by the Madison Group. These sensors have extremely high bandwidths however ($>$ 10 GHz), and did not produce the desired SNR for this relatively low-bandwidth error signal. The power supply noise was measured to be mostly white, so the sensor amplifies it for a much larger bandwidth than that of the error signal, degrading SNR. The Madison group also has readily available battery powered ThorLabs detectors. These sensors have excellent low-frequency noise characteristics, but were, unfortunately, bandwidth limited to 10 MHz, making them also unuseable. A solution was found in a mysterious home-built detector, shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:detector}}. This detector was measured to pass through even the 40 MHz beatnote, with an acceptable noise characteristic, and was deemed fit for use. Both the error signals and the modulation transfer spectra in the data sets are derived from this photosensor.
Presumably some member of the Madison group has the associated schematics and datasheets.

\begin{figure}
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/photosensor.png}
  \caption[Photosensor]{Home-built Madison Group photosensor. It's actual bandwidth and noise characteristics are unknown, but spectrum measurements of the unprocessed error signal deemed it sufficient for use.}
  \label{fig:detector}
\end{figure}


    \subsubsection{Preamplification}
    %===============================

The 20 MHz signal created at the detector is first filtered.  The DC component and everything above 30 MHz are cut out, leaving ideally just the desired 20 MHz signal.  That signal gets passed through two 17dB minicircuits RF amplifiers, which increase the power level of the signal enough to make it usable.  Each amplifier degrades the signal-to-noise by 6 dB, so excessive chaining amplifiers should be avoided if possible.

    \subsubsection{Demodulation}
    %===========================

The preamplified signal is passed into a frequency mixer.  That signal is mixed with the 20 MHz local oscillator (the EOM driver).  This gives us a desired signal at DC.  The mixed signal is then filtered at 10 MHz, which eliminates any unwanted high frequency components.  The selection of frequency is important at this stage.  The higher a the cutoff frequency, the faster the system can respond to changes in the laser's frequency. However, setting a high frequency incurs a noise penalty.  The noise spread is linear, thus a doubling of frequency range decreases the SNR by 3 dB. \\

A 10 MHz cutoff frequency was chosen, primarily to eliminate known nonlinear artifacts of the mixer present at 20 MHz; these filters reduce a signal at $2f_{co}$ (the -3 dB cutoff) by 40 dB.  Reducing this cutoff would further reduce the output noise.

\subsection{Infrastructure}
    \subsubsection{EOM Power Supply}
    %===============================

The homebuilt EOM driver CCA came with its own AC to DC converter.  However, supply noise proved to be a problem, so a custom power supply was developed for this board.  The power supply takes filtered DC lab power, and linearly downregulates to the needed input power.

    \subsubsection{Signal Conditioner Case and Power Distribution}
    %=============================================================

A custom case was built to contain the signal conditioning components, shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:ebox}}.  It also includes a linear regulator which is capable of powering up to four of the minicircuits amplifiers without significant voltage rail dipping.
